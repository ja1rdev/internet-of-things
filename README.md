## 📋 Overview

The IoT LED Control System is a collection of Arduino sketches designed to demonstrate various LED control patterns and behaviors. This project is perfect for learning basic electronics and programming concepts with Arduino.

## ✨ Features

- 💡 Multiple LED control patterns
- 🚦 Traffic light simulation
- 🔄 Circular LED sequence
- ⏱️ Timed LED blinking
- 🎛️ Interactive menu system

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Hardware**: Arduino-compatible board, LEDs, resistors, breadboard
- **Software**: Arduino IDE
- **Programming Language**: C++ (Arduino)

## 📋 Sketches

### 1. Simultaneous LED Blinking
Basic sketch demonstrating simultaneous blinking of multiple LEDs.

### 2. Traffic Light System
Interactive traffic light simulation with two modes:
- **Option 1**: Activate traffic light sequence
- **Option 2**: Deactivate traffic light

### 3. Circular LED Sequence
LEDs light up in a circular pattern, creating a chasing light effect.

### 4. Individual LED Blinking
Individual LEDs blink in sequence, repeating the pattern 5 times.
